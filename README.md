# Análise de Log


## Description of Project

create a reporting tool that prints reports (in plain text) based on 
the data in the database. 
This reporting tool is a Python program using the ``psycopg2`` module 
to connect to the database.

### Tasks that the tool should answer:
 1. **What are the three most popular articles of all time?** 
Which articles were the most accessed? 
  Present this information as an organized list with the most
  popular article at the top.
  
 2. **Who are the authors of most popular articles of all time?** 
 That is, when you organize all the articles that each author wrote,
 which authors get the most views? 
  Present this information as an organized list with the most popular author at the top.
  
 3. **On what days more than 1% of requests resulted in errors?**
The log table includes a column status that indicates the HTTP status code 
that the news site sent to the user's browser 
(see this lesson again if you want to review the idea of ​​HTTP status codes).
